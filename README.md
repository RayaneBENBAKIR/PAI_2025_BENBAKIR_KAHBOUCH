# Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction

This project explores the Titanic dataset through interactive data analysis and
a simple survival prediction model.

The application is built with Streamlit and is intended for educational purposes.

---

## Project objectives

- Explore the main socio-demographic factors influencing survival on the Titanic
- Provide clear visualizations to support data interpretation
- Offer an interactive survival prediction tool based on a machine learning model

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset, containing information about
passengers such as age, sex, socio-economic class, family relations, and survival outcome.

---

## Application features

### Data exploration

- Interactive filters (sex, age, class, embarkation port, travelling alone)
- Summary statistics and descriptive tables
- Visualizations:
  - Survival rate by age group
  - Survival rate by sex
  - Survival rate by socio-economic class

### Survival prediction

- Logistic regression model trained on the dataset
- Input features:
  - Pclass (socio-economic class)
  - Sex
  - Age
  - Fare
  - SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)
  - Parch (parents/children aboard)
  - Output:
  - Survival probability
  - Binary prediction (survived / not survived)
